The players have been tasked with defending the <marker name='mkrVillage'>village of Taga</marker> from CSAT Pacific. Your job is to stage the assault.
<br/><br/>
Feel free to set up units beforehand, but the attack shouldn't happen until nighttime, which will be initiated by the players. Do whatever you want with units, but be aware that RPG-7s aren't very effective against armored targets. There are some VTOLs at the Tanoa airport that have been detoothed a bit if you're interested. The AI are terrible and piloting these, however.
<br/><br/>
There's no built-in victory condition for the players, but feel free to send in a NATO rescue force or something if you think the players deserve a win.
