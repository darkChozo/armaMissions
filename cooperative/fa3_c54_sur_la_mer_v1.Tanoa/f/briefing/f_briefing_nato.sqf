<font size='18'>ANTI-AIR</font>
<br/>
NATO MANPAD teams have been spotted in <marker name='oumere'>Ouméré</marker>; air assets should be careful about engaging too brazenly. There are also heavier anti-air emplacements in <marker name='kotomo'>Kotomo</marker> and the <marker name='iles'>Îles</marker>, so stick close to the AO.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>Vehicles</font>
<br/>
Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie are mechanized squads mounted in Marids. Juliet is in Qilins, and CO has their own armed Qilin. The VTOL is a light attack-varient Xi'an, and the attack helo is an Orca armed with unguided DARs.

<br/>
The <marker name='bridge'>Harcourt bridge</marker> is the key to this war. That bridge is the primary crossing point from the <marker name='iles'>Îles de Lijn</marker> to the mainland, and the main passage for NATO supplies and troops to get to the front lines. Without it, NATO's done for.
<br/><br/>
The town of <marker name='oumere'>Ouméré</marker> is one of two major NATO positions holding the Tanoan side of the bridge. Our mission is to take the town from NATO so we can use it to strike at the bridge and the Îles.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
<br/>
The town has been heavily garrisoned with infantry and light armor. Enemies are concentrated at the <marker name='checkpoint'>checkpoint</marker> on the main road and the cluster of commercial buildings they're using as their <marker name='headquarters'>HQ</marker>.
<br/><br/>
We can also expect a counter attack from the <marker name='iles'>Îles</marker> as soon as NATO can pull one together.
