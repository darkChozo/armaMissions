We have been supplied with 3 IFVs and 4 MRAPs. If Col. Alexandrakis keeps his word, we should also have mortar support.<br/>
<br/>
VEHICLE CREWS TAKE NOTE: Due to the requirements of the tempo of this operation, the IFVs and MRAPs have had their waterjets boosted. While significantly upping the power output, the modification has rendered the control surfaces non-operational during forward motion. Once entering the water, changes of direction can only be achieved by moving in reverse.

Our task is to perform an amphibious landing and take the base from under the enemy's nose. The morning fog should help us.

<br/>
The base is rumoured to contain a small contingent of gunboats. Take special care, they are very, very dangerous.

Despite our best efforts, our advance on Gravia has been halted. The front line is within range of the enemy artillery base just south of Sagonisi. The base has recently been supplemented with significant anti-air capabilities, negating what little CAS we had earlier. We are to put a stop to this nonsense.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
<br/>
We are expecting a squad or two of infantry, a mix of light and medium artillery, and at least a pair of AAA vehicles. Additional reinforcements are likely comming from the west as soon as they figure out what's going on.

None.
