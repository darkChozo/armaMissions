<br/>
The island of Stratis, formerly a keystone of the Hellenic Army's hold on the Mediterranean, was largely abandoned in the 2010s as political and economic turmoil rocked the country. The island quickly became a haven for smugglers and other ne'er-do-wells as the few remaining Greek and Altisan forces found themselves completely unable to police the populace.
<br/><br/>
Following the creation of the Republic of Altis and Stratis and the AAF, it was only natural that Stratis would be a hotbed of resistance. The AAF of Stratis quickly fell to the newly formed Freedom and Independence Army, effectively driving the government off the island. On Altis, FIA were insurgents; on Stratis, they were kings.
<br/><br/>
The year is 2030. With FIA activity on Altis at an all-time low, the AAF sets their sights on Stratis. Codenamed Operation Eleftheria (Operation Freedom), the successful invasion of Stratis would spell the end of the FIA.

<font size='18'>COMMANDER'S INTENT</font>
<br/>
Bravo will be our air assault element, while everyone else will insert by boat. We've only been authorized to land boats in the <marker name='ao'>area designated Pyrgos Beach</marker>. Air can land anywhere, though watch out for the <marker name='nofly'>no fly zone</marker> to the north. This zone is approximate; we have intel that there are troops carrying MANPADS in the region.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>FIRE SUPPORT PLAN</font>
<br/>
Air assault will be conducted by armed Hellcats, which will transition to CAS after they've dropped off their chalk. We also may have naval artillery support. Expect a time to impact of about 40 seconds and as much as 100 meters of dispersion.

<br/>
If we have any hope of taking back Stratis from the FIA, we're gonna need to establish a beachhead on the island. High Command has identified three suitable locations; we've been tasked with assaulting the southernmost one.
<br/><br/>
Due to the area's obvious strategic importance, the FIA has established a series of fortifications on <marker name='hill83'>Hill 83</marker>. Well, we're gonna take it from them.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
<br/>
An unknown number of FIA irregulars. They're going to be heavily dug in so be ready for one hell of a fight.
