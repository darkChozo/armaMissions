<font size='18'>EQUIPMENT</font>
<br/>
The lifeblood of any proper revolution: AKs, RPGs, and civilian trucks. We also managed to grab some American Titans off the black market; I wonder how those got there?
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>PLANE</font>
<br/>
Eloni tricked out one of our smuggling planes with a remotely-operated light machine gun. The copilot can also drop things out the door, things like smoke grenades, frag grenades, and some bombs we improvised out of of barrels of fertilizer.
<br/><br/>
Those things don't exactly fly fast so watch out for fire from the ground, especially from HMGs. If you need to rearm, we've paid off the guys at the <marker name='rearm'>airport</marker> and set up shop with spare parts and ammo.

The <marker name='mine'>Red Spring Surface Mine</marker> belongs to the people! And as representatives of the people, it's our duty to take the mine and use it to finance the revolution.
<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, it looks like the Tanoan Armed Forces caught wind of our plan and garrisoned the mine. Drive out the TAF and take the mine! For the people, of course...
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
<br/>
A platoon or two of TAF infantry supported by light and not-so-light vehicles.
