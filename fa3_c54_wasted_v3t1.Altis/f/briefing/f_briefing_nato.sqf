<font size='18'>RADIATION ZONES</font>
<br/>
Zones of particularly intense radiation are an ever-present danger in the wastes. We're all equipped with geiger counters that will go off when the background radiation reaches dangerous levels. The bandits don't seem to mind the radiation; we're not sure if it doesn't affect them or if they just don't care.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>SCIENTISTS</font>
<br/>
We have a few guys that used to be scientists before the war. They've managed to cobble together some helmets that they say will protect them from the harmful effects of radiation. Should be useful if we need to go into irradiated areas.

<font size='18'>INCENDIARY GRENADES</font>
<br/>
Some of us are equipped with improvised incendiary grenades. IR Grenade = IndcendiaRy grenade. Duh.

<br/>
It's been a year since the end of the world. It was chaos at first, but as time passed people started to group up and settle down in this irradiated hellhole. Unfortunately, there are still people out there that would rather take than produce for themselves.
<br/><br/>
A bandit group operating out of <marker name='charkia'>Charkia</marker> ambushed one of our scavenger convoys, killed the men, and took the the supplies that they'd found. We have no choice; we need those supplies to live. We're going bandit hunting.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
<br/>
This particular group likes to wear motorcycle helmets. No, I don't know why. Rumor is that they formed up after finding a shipment of military weapons in the <marker name='shipyard'>old Charkia storage yard</marker>, so be careful.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>FRIENDLY FORCES</font>
<br/>
We've spotted some unarmed scavengers loitering around the edge of town. Probably trying to grab anything that the bandits leave behind. They won't bother us if we don't bother them.
