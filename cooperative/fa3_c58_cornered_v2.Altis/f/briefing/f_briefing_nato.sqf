This is bad. Sure, we survived the crash, but now we're deep in rebel territory, and Command's not responding on the radio.
<br/><br/>
We have no choice. We've activated the distress beacons on the helos; they'll keep broadcasting even if the helos are destroyed. We hold out, and hope Command sends a rescue party before we all die.

Lots and lots of rebels.
